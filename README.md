## :thought_balloon: misc notes
This is an agile development cycle, so I'm poppin' in features as I come up with them or as folks request them. Expect changes here often, and do not be shocked to find gross code. If you have suggestions, I'm totally open to hear them and learn if you're not a nerf dart about it! :trollface:

 - If you have feature requests, create an Issue to start the discussion!
